 * WebSocket origin validation — defends against Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking.
 *
 * SameSite=Strict alone is NOT enough here: the cookie is non-Secure over
 * plain-HTTP LAN, and a browser "site" excludes the port, so a page served by
 * an installed app on the SAME host but a different port is "same-site" and its
 * WS handshake would still carry the session cookie. So we verify the Origin
 * header (host + port) matches the host the request actually came in on.
 *
 * Only enforced in production: in dev the Vite proxy deliberately makes the
 * Origin (5173) and Host (8723) differ. Browsers always send Origin on a WS
 * handshake, so a missing Origin means a non-browser client (not a CSWSH
 * vector) and is allowed. An optional allowlist supports reverse-proxy setups.
