# Architecture & decisions — OpenMasjidOS

This records non-trivial architectural and naming decisions (per CLAUDE.md §19).
The authoritative product spec is `CLAUDE.md`; this is the "how + why".

## Stack (v0.2.0 — rebuilt to mirror umbrelOS)

OpenMasjidOS is a **TypeScript monorepo** (npm workspaces) shipped as **one Docker
image** that runs a Node daemon serving both the API and the built UI.

```
packages/core   Node 20 + Fastify + tRPC daemon (the "umbreld" equivalent)
packages/ui     React 18 + Vite + Tailwind v4 + Motion dashboard
```

- **API:** tRPC over HTTP for queries/mutations, and **tRPC over WebSocket** for
  live subscriptions (system stats stream every ~2s). Both share the `/trpc`
  prefix via `@trpc/server/adapters/fastify` with `useWSS: true` +
  `@fastify/websocket`.
- **End-to-end types:** the UI imports only the `AppRouter` **type** from the
  core (`import type`). No server runtime ever reaches the browser bundle. UI
  view-models are derived with `inferRouterOutputs` — never hand-duplicated.
- **Docker control:** `dockerode` for reads (container discovery, state, ports)
  and a thin `docker compose` shell wrapper for app lifecycle. All Docker access
  funnels through `packages/core/src/docker/`.
- **System stats:** `systeminformation`. Inside the container, `/proc` reflects
  the host for CPU/memory/uptime, so values describe the machine. CPU temp is
  reported "where available" (null otherwise). Disk reports the filesystem
  backing the mounted data dir.
- **Auth:** argon2id hashing + a random session token in an HTTP-only,
  SameSite=Strict cookie (not Secure — plain-HTTP LAN). Sessions are in-memory.
- **UI serving:** the daemon serves `packages/ui/dist` via `@fastify/static`
  with an SPA fallback to `index.html` for client routes; `/trpc` and `/api`
  never fall back.

## Key decisions

### Build: esbuild bundles the core; Vite builds the UI
`tsc` with CommonJS output + classic Node resolution can't read the package
`exports` maps that `@trpc/server/adapters/fastify` (and the Fastify plugins)
rely on. Rather than fight `module`/`moduleResolution` tensions, the core is
**bundled with esbuild** (`--format=cjs --packages=external`): esbuild resolves
`exports` maps at build time, inlines our relative imports (so there's no Node
ESM file-extension problem), and leaves `node_modules` external (required at
runtime). `tsc --noEmit` remains the type-check (`npm run lint`). The UI is a
plain `vite build`; type-only imports of the core are erased by esbuild, so the
UI build never needs the core's types resolved.

### Password hashing: @node-rs/argon2 (not the `argon2` native module)
CLAUDE.md names the `argon2` package, but its native addon must compile under
musl for the multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) Alpine image, which is slow and brittle
under QEMU. `@node-rs/argon2` ships prebuilt musl + glibc binaries (incl.
`linux-arm64-musl`, `linux-x64-musl`), so the image builds with **no native
compilation**. Same argon2id algorithm; drop-in for our needs.

### Runtime image: Alpine + docker-cli + docker-cli-compose
Mirrors the proven base from the previous Go build. The core shells out to
`docker` / `docker compose`, so the CLI + compose plugin must be present. The
healthcheck uses busybox `wget` against `/api/health`.

### Golden rule enforcement (never touch a user's app containers)
- The installer only ever operates on the core's own compose project
  (`--project-name openmasjid`). Apps are separate projects (`omos-<id>`).
- `apps/manager.listInstalled()` merges on-disk metadata with **live Docker
  discovery**: any running `omos-*` project without metadata is recovered and
  re-shown (and its metadata re-persisted). A running app can never silently
  vanish from the dashboard after a core update.

### Scope delta from the previous (Go/Svelte) build
The rewritten CLAUDE.md scope (§4, §13) does **not** include the file manager or
web terminals that the earlier build had. They are intentionally omitted here.
Backup is implemented as a streaming tar download; restore is deferred (the UI
labels it "coming soon").

## Ports & data
- Default port **8723** (`http://openmasjidos.local:8723` / `http://<ip>:8723`).
- Data dir **/opt/openmasjid** → mounted at `/data`. Config in `/data/config`,
  per-app state in `/data/apps/<id>/`.

## Version
`VERSION` at the repo root is the single source of truth. The Docker build copies
it to `/app/VERSION`; the daemon reads it (`OPENMASJID_VERSION_FILE`). Shown in
Settings → Advanced.
