# OpenMasjidOS core — multi-stage build.
#   1. build:   install the monorepo, build the React UI (Vite) and the
#               TypeScript daemon (tsc), then drop dev dependencies.
#   2. runtime: a slim Node + Docker-CLI image that runs the daemon, which
#               serves the built UI and the tRPC API on one port.
#
# We use Alpine and @node-rs/argon2 (prebuilt musl binaries) so the multi-arch
# (amd64 + arm64) build needs no native compilation. See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.

# ---- Build stage ------------------------------------------------------------
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app

# Copy workspace manifests first so dependency install layers cache well.
COPY package.json ./
COPY packages/core/package.json packages/core/
COPY packages/ui/package.json packages/ui/

# No committed lockfile (the project builds through CI, not a dev's laptop),
# so a plain install resolves the manifests for the current arch.
RUN npm install --no-audit --no-fund

# Copy the rest of the sources and build both packages.
COPY tsconfig.base.json VERSION ./
COPY packages ./packages
RUN npm run build

# Strip dev dependencies (vite, tsc, tsx…) — the runtime only needs prod deps.
RUN npm prune --omit=dev --no-audit --no-fund

# ---- Runtime stage ----------------------------------------------------------
FROM node:20-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app

# The core installs/removes apps by shelling out to `docker` + `docker compose`
# against the mounted host socket, so the CLI and compose plugin must be present.
