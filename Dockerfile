# OpenMasjidOS core — multi-stage build.
#   1. build:   install the monorepo, build the React UI (Vite) and the
#               TypeScript daemon (tsc), then drop dev dependencies.
#   2. runtime: a slim Node + Docker-CLI image that runs the daemon, which
#               serves the built UI and the tRPC API on one port.
#
# We use Alpine and @node-rs/argon2 (prebuilt musl binaries) so the multi-arch
# (amd64 + arm64) build needs no native compilation. See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
